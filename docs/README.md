# strainflow: Documentation

The strainflow documentation is split into the following pages:

- [Usage](usage.md)
  - An overview of how the pipeline works, how to run it and a description of all of the different command-line flags.
- [Parameters](parameters.md)
  - An overview of the parameters.
- [Output](output.md)
  - An overview of the different results produced by the pipeline and how to interpret them.

For this pipeline I used the nf-core template as much as possible. You can find a lot more documentation about installing, configuring and running nf-core pipelines on the website: [https://nf-co.re](https://nf-co.re).
